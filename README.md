Gists
-----

Python wrapper for the Github Gists API, as well as a script for interacting with them.

* `gist.py` is the set of classes used for reading gists
* `interface.py` is an example script for now

A `config.py` file is also required for private Gists:

    # config.py
    user = 'your-github-username'
    password = 'your-github-password'
